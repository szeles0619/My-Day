# My-Day

## Description

Hi and Welcome! This is my First Project in my EDX-Front-End Web Development Bootcamp. When I started building this website my motivation was to create something clean and easy to understand the purpose of it. It is easy to use for everyone from any age.

In this project I learned a lot about Server-Side APIs especially the 2 I used OpenWeatherAPI and REST countries.

## Installation

Only a web browser required for this project, no other installation needed.

## Usage

As a User when you visit the website the Home page will welcome you. You will see first the search bar where you will have to insert your selected city and then click the Search button.

Let's see an example. You would like to go to New York and want to find out what's the weather like. You simply type in New York where it says 'Let's go to ... ' and then click the Search button. 

Just like this :

If you scroll down the page you probably want to find out some useful information of your selected city's country.

Let's stay at the same example. We know that New York is located in the United States. However we would like to find out what the Country's national flag look like, what its capital city, the population and on which continent you can find it.

It will look like this:
